# Campaign Frame: Ruins of the Lost Empire

Pioneers in an unexplored realm uncover the lost secrets and dangers of a long lost civilization.

## The Pitch

A long time ago, a great empire ruled the known world. The empire was known for great achievements of science, magic, and culture that echo throughout the many societies of the current era. However, at the height of their power, this great empire fell. Their ancient cities, the seat of their power, fell to ruin, long forgotten by the modern world. But, the secrets of their power (and the enemy that brought that power down) lay dormant, waiting for bold explorers to uncover them.
Now, countless centuries later, a group of explorers and pioneers have ventured to the realm of this lost empire in hopes to build a settlement and explore their lost secrets. In a Ruins of the Lost Empire campaign, you’ll play leaders of this foundling settlement uncovering the secrets of an ancient empire. However, as you explore the unknown world, you will uncover ancient dangers long forgotten that will threaten the world.

## Player Principles

*If your group decides to play this campaign, give your players the following information before character creation.*

### Pioneers at the Edge of the Known World

When building your character, consider why they would volunteer to join this expedition. Are they a horizon walker, always in search of new lands to explore? Maybe they are an archaeologist or student of ancient history, lured by the promise of ancient relics and ruins? In the alternative, maybe they joined the expedition to escape something in the Old World. There are many reasons somebody might volunteer (or, perhaps, be volunteered) to join this expedition.

### Explorers of Terra Incognita

You are explorers discovering an unknown world. Nobody from the Old World (as far as you know) has set foot in this region. Exploring this long lost world is an important part of why your character is on this journey. Even if they were not the first person to jump up and volunteer to explore this new realm, exploration should still be a main motivation.

### Settlers Far From Home

The people who volunteered to go on this expedition did it with the understanding that they may not see their home for a long time (if ever). While the severity of exactly how far from home depends on choices your group will make during Session Zero, the idea of "making it on your own" should be central to your character and their journey.

## GM Principles

*Keep the following guidance in mind while you GM this campaign.*

### Create Struggle in the Community

This is the story of a settlement struggling to survive on their own. Even if travel from the Old World is possible, it is still infrequent enough that the people of the settlement need to make their way on their own. It may take six weeks for help to come from home, so how do the people of the settlement make do until help arrives? The only people you have are the people you brought, so  disagreements have to be resolved. Sometimes, the greatest danger isn't the monster outside the house, but the fact that the people inside can't agree on how to fight it.

### Center Discovery and Exploration

Exploring this new world and finding evidence of the Lost Empire is an important pillar in this story. While other conflicts should always be present, the PCs should always be have the opportunity to discover new lost relics, treasures, and secrets of the Lost Empire.

### Ancient Dangers

Ancient defenses left by the people long lost. Enemies of the old empire who survived and still threaten the world. There are many opportunities for local threats, but an important part of the story are the threats from long ago.
