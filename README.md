This repository is for storing work related to a Campaign Frame being written for the [**_Daggerheart Role-playing Game_**](https://www.daggerheart.com/) by Darrington Press. However, this document attempts to exand on some of the concepts of the Campaign Frame in order to create something that allows for a group to customize the material to their own interests while also providing structured content to support the Game Master.

Significant inspiration for this document comes from [**_Spectaculars_**](https://scratchpadpublishing.com/spectaculars), a tabletop role-playing game developed by Rodney Thompson.

## Context and Explanation

In **_Daggerheart_**, a Campaign Frame is a structure for campaigns.

### What is a Campaign Frame?

From the [**_Daggerheart_** SRD](https://www.daggerheart.com/srd/):

>A campaign frame provides inspiration, tools, and mechanics to support a particular type of story at the table.
>Every campaign frame has a complexity rating that indicates how much its mechanics deviate from or expand upon the Daggerheart core ruleset.
>Each campaign frame includes the following sections.
>
> * A pitch to present to players
> * Suggestions and guidance on tone, feel, themes, and touchstones
> * An overview of the campaignâ€™s background
> * Guidance for fitting communities, ancestries, and classes into the setting
> * Principles for players and GMs to focus on during the campaign
> * Unique setting distinctions
> * An inciting incident to launch the campaign
> * Special mechanics to use during the campaign
> * Questions to consider during session zero

### How does this Campaign Frame differ?

There are two major ways in which this deviates from the guidelines provided in the **_Daggerheart_** SRD.

The first major deviation is that significant narrative elements (nations, important NPCs, etc.) are left unspecified, with a series of prompts to help a GM or group create their own. In that way, multiple groups can utilize the same Campaign Frame but have a very different experience.

The second major deviation is that potential session guidelines (presented as a one-page adventure) are provided that present a guide for a session of play that connects the various narrative elements. These "adventures" are not required to utilize the Campaign Frame but are instead intended to provide some narrative direction for GMs that desire some structure.
